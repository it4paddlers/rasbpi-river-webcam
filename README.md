# raspi-river-webcam

The goal of this project is to build a river webcam using a raspberry pi.

### Why raspberry pi?

There are some out-of-box outdoor security cam solutions on the market and some of them might be suitable for being used as a river webcam. However, most of these solutions are expensive, not customizable, and always bear the risk of being discontinued by the manufacturer. Building a custom river webcam solution using a raspberry aims to meet the following objectives:
* **reproducibility**: the wide adoption of raspberry pis hopefully decreases the risk for the project to die because of discontinuation of the hardware 
* **scalability**: raspberry pis are very affordable and widely available, hence the number of river cams can be increased quickly if the solution proofs to be good. 
* ...
